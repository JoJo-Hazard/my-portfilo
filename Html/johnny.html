            I am a person who is positive about every aspect of life. 
            There are many things I like to do, to see, and to experience. 
            I like to read, I like to write; I like to think, I like to dream; I like to talk, I like to listen.
            I like to see the sunrise in the morning, see the moonlight at night; 
            feel the music flowing on my face, I like to smell the wind coming from the ocean. 
            look at the clouds in the sky with a blank mind, 
            do thought experiment when I cannot sleep in the middle of the night. 
            flowers in spring, rain in summer, leaves in autumn, and snow in winter. 
            leep early, I like to get up late; I like to be alone, I like to be surrounded by people. 
            country’s peace, I like metropolis’ noise; I like the beautiful west lake in Hangzhou, 
            the flat cornfield in Champaign. I like delicious food and comfortable shoes;
            I like good books and romantic movies. I like the land and the nature, I like people. 
            And, I like to laugh.
